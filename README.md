# Microsoft-Excel-Projects
 Using over 70 advanced Excel Formulas, I did two projects on Sales Analysis and Financial Analysis. I used advanced formulas, Power Query, Pivot Table and Power Pivot concepts, along with Scenario Planning and Project Priority Matrix. Concepts like Power Pivot & DAX, uncovering deeper insights from big  data.
